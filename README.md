## Configuring

Settings for atom-wakatime are under `Settings → Packages → wakatime → Settings`.

Additional settings are in `$HOME/.wakatime.cfg` for [wakatime cli](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#configuring).

## Troubleshooting

Atom writes errors to the Atom Developer Console. To check for errors:

1. Turn on the debug checkbox in `Settings → Packages → wakatime → Settings`
2. Inside Atom, go to `View → Developer → Toggle Developer Tools`
3. Clear the developer console (the circle button top left of the console)
4. Inside Atom, go to `View → Developer → Reload Window`

That will reload all plugins including WakaTime, and you should see the startup process logged in the developer console.
If there are no errors in your developer console after startup and editing a file, then check for errors in your `~/.wakatime/wakatime.log` file.

For checking your `~/.wakatime/wakatime.log` file, see [wakatime/wakatime#troubleshooting](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime#troubleshooting).
